**Segmentation of Car Parts** is a dataset for instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, and object detection tasks. Possible applications of the dataset could be in the retail industry. 

The dataset consists of 211 images with 3670 labeled objects belonging to 4 different classes including *car*, *wheel*, *window*, and other: *lights*.

Images in the Car Segmentation dataset have pixel-level instance segmentation annotations. Due to the nature of the instance segmentation task, it can be automatically transformed into a semantic segmentation (only one mask for every class) or object detection (bounding boxes for every object) tasks. All images are labeled (i.e. with annotations). There are no pre-defined <i>train/val/test</i> splits in the dataset. The dataset was released in 2021 by the INTELEC.AI.
